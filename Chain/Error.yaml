  Instead of utilizing HTTP status codes to describe node errors (which often
  do not have a good analog), rich errors are returned using this object.
type: object
required:
  - code
  - message
  - retriable

    format: int32

    example: 12
  message:
    description: |
      Message is a network-specific error message.
    type: string
    example: "Invalid account format"
  retriable:
    description: |

      again.
    type: boolean

      Often times it is useful to return context specific
      to the request that caused the error (i.e. a sample of the
      stack trace or impacted account) in addition to the
      standard error message.
    example:
      address: "0x1dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6"
      error: "not base64"
